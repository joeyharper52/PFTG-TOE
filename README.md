## 🌀 A Field-Based Theory of Everything

The Pressure-Field Theory of Gravity (PFTG) proposes a unified framework where gravity, electromagnetism, and the nuclear forces emerge from coherent modes of a fundamental pressure field Φ. Unlike spacetime curvature models, PFTG defines gravity as a dynamic response to spatial pressure gradients, enabling elegant coupling across energy scales.

## 🔬 Abstract

This work develops a field-based alternative to General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory by modeling all interactions as emergent pressure dynamics. Gauge fields (U(1), SU(2), SU(3)) arise as harmonic modes of a unified scalar field Φ(x), with solitonic structures representing particles and energy distributions. Entropy gradients generate effective forces, predicting lensing, rotation curves, and gravitational wave analogs without requiring dark matter or dark energy.

## 🚀 Goals of the PFTG Framework

- ✅ Replace spacetime curvature with pressure gradient physics  
- ✅ Derive gauge interactions from harmonic field modes  
- ✅ Unify field dynamics across EM, weak, strong, and gravity  
- ✅ Produce falsifiable predictions for lensing, CMB, and more  
- ✅ Support soliton-based particle analogs within the same framework
