## 🧠 Abstract

The Pressure-Field Theory of Gravity (PFTG) proposes a unified framework where gravity, gauge forces, mass, and quantum behavior all emerge from a single scalar pressure field, \( \Phi(x, t) \).  
It replaces spacetime curvature with pressure gradients, interprets fundamental forces as harmonics of the field, and models particles as soliton wavepackets in the same pressure medium.
